# Editor Report: Incremental Codex Mirror Review

## Findings

### Fixed: watch-mode churn is no longer an acceptance blocker

The Builder added a local session cache at:

- `offline-codex-transcripts-live/decoded/session-cache.json`

The cache is protected by the existing `offline-codex-transcripts-*/` ignore rule. `git check-ignore` confirms the cache and other offline mirror outputs remain ignored.

Verification showed the second mirror run completed in about 2.15 seconds with cache-heavy metadata:

- `parsed: 1`
- `cache_hits: 36`
- `skipped: 0`

This materially fixes the watch-mode churn problem.

### Acceptable: behavior appears preserved

The mirror still updates the compact memory files under `memory-bank/`, still writes decoded latest-session output under the offline mirror, and still keeps raw mirror data local-only.

### Remaining concern: the mirror script is large

`tools/codex_transcript_mirror.py` is now 896 lines. The added cache logic is readable and grouped, but the file combines:

- CLI parsing;
- session discovery;
- JSONL parsing;
- cache management;
- topic classification;
- Markdown rendering;
- filesystem mirroring;
- watch-loop behavior.

This is not an immediate correctness blocker, but it is a maintainability problem that should be fixed soon.

## Recommendation

Accept the Builder incremental fix.

Open a separate Editor refactor directive to split the mirror into smaller behavior-preserving sections/modules. That refactor should not change mirror output or tracking policy.
