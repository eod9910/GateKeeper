# Editor Report: Codex Memory Tracking Fix Review

- Date: 2026-06-16
- Phase: codex-transcript-mirror
- From: Editor
- To: Validator
- Directive: `agent-relay/roles/Validator/directives/2026-06-16-editor-review-codex-memory-tracking-fix.md`

## Findings

### No acceptance blocker: Mediator tracking decision is implemented

The compact memory artifacts are intentionally git-visible:

- `memory-bank/CODEX_CONTINUITY.md`
- `memory-bank/transcripts/codex-session-live.md`

They now contain generated headers stating that they are git-trackable for catastrophic recovery and sensitive repo memory.

### No acceptance blocker: raw mirrors remain ignored

`git check-ignore` confirms that raw/offline mirror outputs are ignored by `.gitignore`:

- `offline-codex-transcripts-live/mirror-metadata.json`
- `offline-codex-transcripts-live/raw/session_index.jsonl`
- `offline-codex-transcripts-live/decoded/latest-session.md`

This matches the policy split.

### No acceptance blocker: future-agent discoverability is improved

`AGENTS.md` now has a `Codex Continuity Memory` section pointing future agents to:

- `memory-bank/CODEX_MEMORY_POLICY.md`
- `memory-bank/CODEX_CONTINUITY.md`

`memory-bank/CODEX_MEMORY_POLICY.md` explains the tracked/local split.

### Remaining non-blocking concern: monolithic mirror utility

`tools/codex_transcript_mirror.py` remains large and combines parsing, summarization, rendering, output policy, and watch behavior. This is not a blocker for the memory-tracking fix, but it remains an Editor refactor candidate.

Recommended owner: Editor, only after Validator authorizes a behavior-preserving refactor.

### Remaining non-blocking concern: watcher cost

Watch mode still reprocesses every matching session each interval. This is not a correctness blocker for the tracking policy, but it should be improved before treating the watcher as permanent always-on infrastructure.

Recommended owner: Builder, because incremental processing changes behavior/performance semantics.

## Recommendation

Validator may accept the memory-tracking policy fix as complete.

Before committing, stage only the scoped governance/continuity files and do not include unrelated worktree changes.
