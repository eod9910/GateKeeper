# Editor Report: Codex Transcript Mirror Contract Review

- Date: 2026-06-16
- Phase: codex-transcript-mirror
- From: Editor
- To: Validator
- Directive: `agent-relay/roles/Validator/directives/2026-06-16-editor-review-codex-transcript-mirror.md`

## Findings

### High: Generated memory-bank transcript files may be commit-visible

`memory-bank/CODEX_CONTINUITY.md` and `memory-bank/transcripts/codex-session-live.md` are generated from user/assistant transcript content and are currently visible as untracked files. They may contain sensitive prompts, private reasoning context, repo state, or market/trading discussion.

Raw mirror output is correctly ignored via `offline-codex-transcripts-*/`, but the compact generated memory files also need an explicit tracking policy before acceptance.

Recommended owner: Validator decides policy with Mediator. Builder implements ignore/output changes if required.

### Medium: Mirror script is monolithic and largely duplicates Cursor mirror concepts

`tools/codex_transcript_mirror.py` is about 754 lines. That is manageable for a v1 utility, but it bundles discovery, parsing, classification, rendering, file copying, memory-bank writing, and watch behavior into one file.

This does not violate behavior correctness, but it does create future maintenance drag. If the Cursor and Codex mirrors both remain, shared memory-summary/rendering helpers should eventually be extracted.

Recommended owner: Editor can refactor structure only after Validator authorization. Builder should handle behavior changes.

### Medium: Watch mode reprocesses every matching session on every interval

The watcher runs every 30 seconds and regenerates decoded outputs for all matching sessions. On this repo it mirrored 34 sessions and took roughly 30 seconds in a one-shot run, which means watch cycles may overlap in practice only because the loop sleeps after each run, but it still creates heavy OneDrive churn.

Recommended owner: Builder should implement incremental processing by mtime/checksum if this is intended to stay always-on.

### Low: Current code intentionally avoids high-risk Codex state

The script reads `~/.codex/sessions` and `session_index.jsonl`. It does not copy `auth.json`, SQLite logs, plugin caches, memories DBs, or credential-like files. That boundary is correct.

Recommended owner: no correction required.

### Low: PowerShell process controls are conventional

The start/stop scripts use PID files and hidden `Start-Process`. They are consistent with the existing Cursor mirror launcher style.

Recommended owner: no correction required.

## Acceptance Recommendation

Do not fully accept this as final until the memory-bank tracking policy is resolved.

Acceptable as a v1 local experiment if:

- raw mirror output remains ignored;
- generated memory-bank transcript files are either ignored or explicitly approved as tracked local governance artifacts;
- the live watcher is understood to be a temporary v1 and not permanent infrastructure.

## Recommended Next Directive

Validator should issue a Builder directive to fix the privacy/tracking policy first. If the Mediator wants the mirror to become durable infrastructure, Validator should then issue a separate Builder directive for incremental processing. After that, Editor can perform an authorized refactor pass to reduce script size and duplication without changing behavior.
