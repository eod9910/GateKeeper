# Builder Report: Codex Transcript Mirror

- Date: 2026-06-16
- Source request: Build a Codex equivalent of the Cursor transcript mirror.

## Implemented

- Added `tools/codex_transcript_mirror.py`.
- Added `tools/start_codex_transcript_mirror.ps1`.
- Added `tools/stop_codex_transcript_mirror.ps1`.
- Added `offline-codex-transcripts-*/` to `.gitignore`.
- Generated `memory-bank/CODEX_CONTINUITY.md`.
- Generated `memory-bank/transcripts/codex-session-live.md`.

## Behavior

The mirror reads workspace-matching Codex rollout JSONL files from `~/.codex/sessions`, copies raw session files into `offline-codex-transcripts-live/`, exports decoded Markdown/JSON views, and writes compact continuity files to `memory-bank/`.

The launcher starts a hidden Python watch process with a 30 second polling interval.

## Verification

- `python -m py_compile tools/codex_transcript_mirror.py` passed.
- One-shot mirror completed and reported 34 mirrored sessions.
- `memory-bank/CODEX_CONTINUITY.md` identified the current thread and latest user prompt.
- Live mirror process started as Python PID 40732.

## Known Limitations

- The watcher reprocesses all matching sessions each cycle.
- A future hardening pass should make processing incremental by timestamp/checksum.
- Raw transcript output is local and ignored, but generated memory-bank summaries may still contain sensitive conversation details.
