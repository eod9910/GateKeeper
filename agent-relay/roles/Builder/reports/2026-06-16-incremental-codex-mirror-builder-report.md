# Builder Report: Incremental Codex Mirror

- Date: 2026-06-16
- Phase: codex-transcript-mirror-cleanup
- From: Builder
- To: Validator
- Directive: `agent-relay/roles/Validator/directives/2026-06-16-builder-incremental-codex-mirror.md`

## Files Changed

- `tools/codex_transcript_mirror.py`
- Generated compact memory refresh:
  - `memory-bank/CODEX_CONTINUITY.md`
  - `memory-bank/transcripts/codex-session-live.md`

## Implementation

Added a local ignored session cache under the offline mirror output:

- `offline-codex-transcripts-live/decoded/session-cache.json`

The cache stores parsed Codex rollout records keyed by source path plus file signature. On later runs, unchanged rollout files are reconstructed from cache instead of reparsed.

Also added change-aware text writes and raw-copy skipping so unchanged raw and decoded session outputs are not rewritten just because watch mode wakes up.

## Verification

- `python -m py_compile tools/codex_transcript_mirror.py` passed.
- First mirror run completed and populated the cache.
- Second mirror run completed in about 2.15 seconds.
- Second run metadata reported:
  - `parsed: 1`
  - `cache_hits: 36`
  - `skipped: 0`
- The active session still updated the compact memory files.

## GitNexus Note

GitNexus impact lookup for `mirror_once` resolves to the older Cursor mirror because both tools use the same function name. A file-path context lookup for the Codex mirror did not resolve the new symbol. The available impact result for the same-name Cursor function showed low risk and no affected execution flows. This Codex change is confined to the standalone mirror utility.

## Remaining Concern For Editor

The mirror utility is still monolithic. The performance problem is fixed, but Editor should decide whether a behavior-preserving structural refactor is required before acceptance.
