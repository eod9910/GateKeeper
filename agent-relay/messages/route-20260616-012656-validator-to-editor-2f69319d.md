# Validator Directive: Review Codex Transcript Mirror

- Date: 2026-06-16
- Phase: codex-transcript-mirror
- From: Validator
- To: Editor
- Work tier: Tier 2 governance/continuity infrastructure

## Request

Review the Codex transcript mirror work for compliance with the Tri-Agent Coding Contract, especially the anti-spaghetti standard.

## Artifacts To Review

- `tools/codex_transcript_mirror.py`
- `tools/start_codex_transcript_mirror.ps1`
- `tools/stop_codex_transcript_mirror.ps1`
- `.gitignore`
- `memory-bank/CODEX_CONTINUITY.md`
- `memory-bank/transcripts/codex-session-live.md`

## Review Scope

Check for:

- maintainability and readability;
- unnecessary complexity;
- duplicated logic copied from the Cursor mirror without good reason;
- privacy or commit-safety risks;
- long-running process risks;
- whether generated memory-bank files should be tracked or ignored;
- whether the implementation creates a parallel system that should instead reuse existing repo memory/relay conventions.

## Required Output

Return an Editor report to Validator with:

- findings ordered by severity;
- whether any correction is required before acceptance;
- whether corrections should be assigned to Builder or Editor;
- recommended next directive.

Do not modify files in this review pass unless Validator separately authorizes an Editor refactor.
