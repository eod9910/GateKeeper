## Request

Review the Builder's Codex memory tracking fix.

## Inputs

- Builder report: `agent-relay/roles/Builder/reports/2026-06-16-codex-memory-tracking-builder-report.md`
- Policy doc: `memory-bank/CODEX_MEMORY_POLICY.md`

## Review Questions

- Does the implementation match the Mediator decision to track compact memory artifacts?
- Are raw transcript mirrors still protected from git?
- Is the policy discoverable by future agents?
- Is there any immediate no-spaghetti blocker before a scoped git commit?
- If more cleanup is needed, should it be assigned to Builder or Editor?
